# wordle_solver
Program that helps to solve a game of Wordle.

What: 
This is a small project that will help find the word while playing a game of Wordle. 

Why:
Because sometimes wordle can get hard. We used to play a Wordle every day before my old ICS class began
and I figured I could write something to make it easier/faster.

How:
Pretty basic, copy both the updated_wordle.py file and the 5_letter_dict.txt file into your directory. 
Run the program from the terminal while you play your wordle game and input information as you progress.

After each iteration, a list of possible word solutions will be output for you to choose from. Choose a word that
you think you may be the answer and input it to the wordle game. If it is not the answer, take the new information
you get and input it into the program. As you play, the solution list will get smaller and smaller as it refines
which words meet the criteria you entered.
